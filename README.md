As a self-taught developer, it is hard to get the motivation to learn data structures. So I had an idea : what if I could make learning them a project ? That's why I'm here creating graphical representation of common data structures.

I do like scratching my head on hard things, and that's a perfect idea for that. I love exploring complex CSS features & tricks (I'm even using Sass to add a layer of complexity!). I do find this project challenging.
